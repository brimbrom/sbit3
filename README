sbit3 is a tornado app and a client script that allows you to easily upload
a file from any command line into Amazon's S3 service. It provides you 
with a shorterned, time-limited URL that you can share to anyone.

I created it because I often am SSH'd 2-3x into a private network and 
wanted to easily pull out files, e.g. a log file or sql dump.

Server dependencies:
 * Python 2.6
 * Tornado
 * Boto
 * Amazon AWS account with S3 & SDB

Client dependencies (to upload files):
 * Linux/OSX/Windows (cygwin) with python2.6

Download dependencies:
 * Any system with HTTP abilities

TODO:
 * Add some error handling
 * S3 cleanup code once files are expired
 * Allow client-side encryption pre-uplaod

Usage:
1) Use sbit3_upload to upload the file:
shell $: ./sbit3_upload your_file.zip
http://sbit3.me/d/aV8gt

2) Share the short URL with someone. If they use a command line, they'll
need to pass curl the -L (follow redirects) and to specify a filename 
since curl doesn't guess the filename like browsers ("-o output.zip"):
shell $: curl -L http://sbit3.me/d/aV8gt -o output.zip
