sbit3 is like pastebin for files.

It is a tornado app and a client script that allows you to easily upload
a file from any command line into Amazon's S3 service. It provides you 
with a shorterned, time-limited URL that you can share to anyone.

You can run the server on your own AWS account if you'd like. 
As a server, sbit3 uses no local storage and only minimal amounts
of CPU and RAM, as most S3 interactions are direct and not proxied.

INSTALL:
Download the client to upload and share a file:
curl http://sbit3.me/sbit3 -o [somewhere in your path]

USAGE:
1) Use sbit3 to upload the file:
    user@localhost:~$ ./sbit3 your_file.zip
    http://sbit3.me/d/aV8gt (link expires in 10 minutes)
or to specify your own expiration time:
    user@localhost:~$ ./sbit3 --expires 42 your_file.zip
    http://sbit3.me/d/aSI38 (link expires in 42 minutes)

2) Share the short URL with someone.
If they use a command line, they'll need to pass curl the  -L option 
to follow redirects and to specify a filename since curl doesn't 
guess the filename like browsers ("-o output.zip"):
    user@localhost:~$ curl -L http://sbit3.me/d/aV8gt -o output.zip
