sbit3 is a tornado app and a client script that allows you to easily upload
a file from any command line into Amazon's S3 service. It provides you 
with a shorterned, time-limited URL that you can share to anyone.

I created it because I often am SSH'd 2-3x into a private network and 
wanted to easily pull out files, e.g. a log file or sql dump.

Server dependencies:
 * Python 2.6
 * Tornado
 * Boto
 * Amazon AWS account with S3 & SDB

Client dependencies (to upload files):
 * Linux/OSX/Windows (cygwin) with python2.6

Download dependencies:
 * Any system with HTTP abilities
